# Data Structure and Algorithm Practice

This repo is about the solution of various programming problems from different online judges.
Also, I will add implementation of a few data structures and alogrithms from scratch.

### Data Structure Implementation
- [ ] Linked List (Single, Doubly, Circular)
- [ ] Stack and Queue (Priority Queue)
- [ ] Tree (Binary, N-ary Tree)
- [ ] Heap

### Algorithm Implementation
- [x] Merge sort
- [ ] Quick sort
- [ ] Heap sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [ ] Count sort
- [ ] Bineary search
- [ ] Breadth first search
- [ ] Depth first search
- [ ] Dijkstra 
- [ ] Bellman-ford
