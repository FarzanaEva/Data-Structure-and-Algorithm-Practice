# Data Structure and Algorithm Practice

This repo is about the solution of various programming problems from different online judges.
Also, I will add the implementation of a few data structures and alogrithms from scratch.

### Data Structure Implementation
- [ ] Linked List
  - [x] Singly Linked List
  - [ ] Doubly Linked List
  - [ ] Circular Linked List
- [ ] Stack and Queue
  - [x] Stack
  - [x] Queue
  - [ ] Priority Queue
- [ ] Tree
  - [ ] Binary Tree
  - [ ] N-ary Tree
- [ ] Heap
  - [ ] Min Heap
  - [ ] Max Heap

### Algorithm Implementation
- [x] Merge sort
- [ ] Quick sort
- [ ] Heap sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [ ] Count sort
- [x] Bineary search
- [ ] Breadth first search
- [ ] Depth first search
- [ ] Dijkstra 
- [ ] Bellman-ford
